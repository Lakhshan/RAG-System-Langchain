2)Query : What is attention mechanisms and how is it better ?
Response:According to the input, an attention mechanism is a method for learning to map and prioritize elements in a sequence or set of sequences, where the focus is on extracting information relevant to the current position on the sequence. The method is based on the idea of weighted summation, where a weight is given for different aspects of the sequence to determine the most relevant element. In the example provided, a self-attention mechanism exhibits behavior associated with the structure of the sentence, where the attention heads exhibit behavior related to the verb 'making'. This mechanism is considered better as it can execute operations faster than a recurrent layer.

The world's two most populated countries, India and China, together constitute about 36% of the world's population.

Northern America, primarily consisting of the United States and Canada, has a population of around 368 million (5%), and Oceania, the least populated region, has about 42 million inhabitants (0.5%).[85] Antarctica only has a very small, fluctuating population of about 1200 people based mainly in polar science stations.[86]"),
